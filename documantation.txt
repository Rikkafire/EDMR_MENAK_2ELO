This is the documantation of the EMDR APP 


First we made the widget tree :-we put the selectednotifiers there so select the page from the nar_bar...
Second we made the notifiers :-to select the selectednotifiers from the nav nar_bar
Third we made the pages folder :-to organize the pages place 
                                       (we should trans. the files of the pages to folders to put everything in it)
Fourth we started working in the settings :in the app bar :
                                      we put bluthooth icon button: (ktob hon ya 7atom)
                                           in the body:
                                                 since we have only range from 1 --> 9 in everything
                                                 we put 3 sliders(Brightness,Intensity(sound),Intensity(vibration))
                                                 in a container that are in a coloumn,and we put 8 colors to change 
                                                 the led colors and types of sounds (clap..) and types of vibration
                                                 like (dots...).
